## Envelope

The return value for `encrypt` is known as the _envelope_, an object with properties:

- `ciphertext` [`Uint8Array`][Uint8Array]: the corresponding ciphertext for _plaintext_.

- `nonce` [`Uint8Array`][Uint8Array]: a [`nonceLength`][tweetnacl-nonce-length] random nonce.

Since the nonce is included in the result, you do not need to add one. If you wish to use a different nonce, assign it to the `nonce` property of the envelope. You may serialize the envelope using [`convert`][convert].
